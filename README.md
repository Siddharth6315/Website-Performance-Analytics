# Website-Performance-Analytics
Web analytics project using Python(Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn &amp; Matplotlib)
# Project Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project on website performance. The goals are to clean and prepare the exported session data, answer a set of business questions about traffic and engagement, and produce visualizations and short, actionable insights.

# Key business questions this project answers:
1) What patterns or trends can you observe in website sessions and users over time?
2) Which marketing channel brought the highest number of users to the website, and how can we use this insight to improve traffic from other sources?
3) Which channel has the highest average engagement time, and what does that tell us about user behavior and content effectiveness?
4) How does engagement rate vary across different traffic channels?
5) Which channels are driving more engaged sessions compared to non-engaged ones, and what strategies can improve engagement in underperforming channels?
6) At what hours of the day does each channel drive the most traffic?
7) Is there any correlation between high traffic (sessions) and high engagement rate over time?
